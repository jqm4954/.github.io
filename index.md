### About Me

I am from a suburb just outside of Rochester, NY. I graduated from Eastridge High School. Throughout High School I was very involved in different music programs as a percussionist in my school's wind ensemble, marching band, and indoor percussion ensemble. I love to play video games and hang out with my friends.
